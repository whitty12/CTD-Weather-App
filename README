Project Description:

This is a very basic HTML/CSS project that runs Express for the server with the possiblity for a React implementation later. It reads data provided by OpenMeteo API to give a weather forecast for the next six days, as well as the current weather.


Project Dependencies:
    - Node.js
    - Node Express
    - Javascript

Options to run this project:
    - Liveserver extension via Visual Code
    - Port 4000 using Express.js

Using express server:
    - Open the terminal in VS code
    - Run "npm start" in the command line
    - navigate to localhost:4000
    - Page is loaded!
    - If onload fails to trigger, click the "temperature" button

Using Liveserver Extension in VS Code:
    - Use ctrl-shift-x to open the extension tab or navigate to the extension panel on the side navigationbar in VS Code.
    - Install Live Server by Ritwick Day.
    - Make sure you are in the project folder you wish to open.
    - Right click on the file you wish to run and select "Run live server" or navigate to the Visual Vode terminal and select the live server   icon.
    - This will open a page with everything loaded.

Issues you may encounter while installing:
    - npm not found
        - Fixes:
            - Restart VSCode
            - Verify installation of Node.js using node -v or npm -v in the command line. 
            Do this inside and outside of the project to verify if it is an issue with the program installation.
    - Unable to run script:
        - This bug can appear on windows. Fixes:
            - Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
                - This will enable the user to run the install scripts for npm
    
Recommended Improvements:
    - Add color and images to the color scheme
    - Fix the class and ID's of each portion of the html so it better aligns with naming conventions and makes the CSS more flexible
    - Consider implementing React
    - Use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap
    - Implementing in React to make the web page more scalable
    - Add media queries to resize according to screen size (XL, L, M, Sm, Xs)
    - Condense all the individual queries in JS to a loop that increments. The current approach is very naive and wouldn't be scalable, but is not needed for a weekly forecast.
