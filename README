## Project Description:
This is a very basic HTML/CSS project that runs Express for the server. It reads data provided by OpenMeteo API to give a weather forecast for the next six days, as well as the current weather.

## Project Dependencies:
    - Node.js
    - Node Express
    - Javascript

## Run

### Using Express Server:
    (1) Open the terminal
    (2) Run "npm start" in the command line
    (3) navigate to localhost:4000
    (4) Page is loaded!

### Using Liveserver Extension in VS Code:
    (1) Use ctrl-shift-x to open the extension tab or navigate to the extension panel on the side navigationbar in VS Code.
    (2) Install Live Server by Ritwick Day.
    (3) Make sure you are in the project folder you wish to open.
    (4) Right click on the file you wish to run and select "Run live server" or navigate to the Visual Vode terminal and select the live server   icon.
    (5) This will open a page with everything loaded.

## Issues you may encounter while installing:
    (1) npm not found
        - Fixes:
            - Restart VSCode
            - Verify installation of Node.js using node -v or npm -v in the command line. 
            Do this inside and outside of the project to verify if it is an issue with the program installation.
    (2) Unable to run script:
        - This bug can appear on windows. Fixes:
            - Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
                - This will enable the user to run the install scripts for npm

## Navigation:
    (1) Input must be a valid latitutde and longitude number or the system will display an error and do nothing.
    (2) You can use either press enter or use the search button to get the weather at a latitude and longitude
    (3) The temperature and precipitation buttons navigate between two pages with different information regarding humidity and climate.

## Recommended Improvements:
    - Use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap
    - Implementing in React to make the web page more scalable
    - Condense all the individual element selectors in JS to using a method that builds from a template. The current approach is very naive and wouldn't be scalable, but is not needed for a weekly forecast.
